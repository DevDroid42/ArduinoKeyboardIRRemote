# A Program to Control Your PC with IR Remote using Arduino

Greetings to all who dare to take,

A journey through this code to make,

Where an IR remote can control,

Your PC, with no need for console.


## Introduction

This project aims to bridge,

The gap between remote and PC's ridge,

Using Arduino as the bridge,

You can control your PC with ease.


## Dependencies

To get this program up and running,

A few dependencies are worth mentioning,

Arduino IDE, version sixteen,

Should be installed on your machine.


## Getting Started

To start this program's adventure,

The first step is to configure,

The hardware, and its connections,

So, follow along with these directions:


### Step 1: Gather the Hardware

To get this program on the road,

A few hardware pieces must be bestowed,

An Arduino Uno, a USB cable,

And an IR receiver, if you're able.


### Step 2: Connect the Hardware

Once the hardware's gathered,

It's time to connect it and not be flattered,

Connect the Arduino to your PC,

Using the USB cable, and let it be.


### Step 3: Upload the Code

With the hardware connected and ready,

It's time to upload the code, already!

Open the Arduino IDE, and select the board,

And then, copy the code, it's not too hard.


### Step 4: Test the Program

With the code uploaded, and the hardware set,

It's time to test the program, don't you fret.

Grab your IR remote and point it towards the IR receiver,

And press the buttons to see if the code's a believer.


## Conclusion

With these simple steps, you've made,

A program that can take,

Input from an IR remote,

And control your PC, like a pro.


## Acknowledgements

Thanks to those who have gone before,

And made the code that we adore,

Their code and ideas we did explore,

And now, we present to you, our own, encore.
